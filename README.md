# BillCypher
 This is an android bill splitting application which uses OCR to split a bill.
 It uses Java along with the Firebase Machine Learning Toolkit.
 The user takes a picture of the receipt and the application captures all the items from the receipt using character recognition.
 The user then enters the number of people, service charge, any VAT and the amount each person owes is calculated.
